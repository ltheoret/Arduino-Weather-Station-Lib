# Arduino-Weather-Station-Lib
An Arduino Library for Weather station converstions

This is a work in progress. Just started my first Library.
This library includes converstions for a Arduino Weather station that gatheres temperature, humidity and berametric pressure.

The code is writen and tested on a Genuino Zero. With a DHT22 and a BMP280 Barometric pressure and a 20x4 I2C LCD.
Also in the circuit is a I2C frendly level shifter.
This is for the Library only but did not have time to test it on its own yet.
